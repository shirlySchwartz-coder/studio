Initiate project refactoring: Identify scattered and duplicated type and interface definitions across the codebase (including @types.ts). Consolidate all core domain entities (Classes, Interfaces) into the dedicated src/Models/ directory. Delete redundant definitions and update all project imports to establish a single, consistent source of truth for all types, enhancing maintainability and readability.
